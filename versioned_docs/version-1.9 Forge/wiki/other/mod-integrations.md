Mod integration is outsourced to a second mod [VampirismIntegrations](https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismIntegrations) [Download](https://minecraft.curseforge.com/projects/vampirism-integrations/files).  
Only integrations for JEI and Guide-API remain part of the main mod.  
  
For a list of implemented integrations head over to the Integrations [wiki](https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismIntegrations/wiki).
