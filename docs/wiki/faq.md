#### I want more skillpoints
There are two ways of having more skillpoints by changinc config values:
1) You can increase the `skillPointsPerLevel` value in the `vampirism-balance.toml` (eg. to 1.5 to have enough skillpoint on lvl 14 to unlock all skills)
2) You can set the `unlockAllSkills` value in the `vampirism-server.toml` to `true` to be able to unlock all skills on max level

If you are more interested in a general powerup for vampires you can install the [Vampirism Godly](https://www.curseforge.com/minecraft/mc-mods/godly-vampirism) Mod. It automatically increases the `skillPointsPerLevel` value
#### I can't bite/feed
1) Make sure the keybinding is not blocked by another mod
2) Check if a red fang icon is displayed when looking at the entity
3) Make sure to hold down the feed button

#### Fire damage is too high
This can be configured in the *balance* configuration. See https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/wiki/Configuration

#### I want werewolves etc.
Go write an addon mod for Vampirism (see https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismAddonExample) or wait for https://github.com/TeamLapen/Werewolves

#### How do I get vampire blood
Killing a Vampire NPC with a Stake is the traditional method of getting Vampire Blood. Only the final hit has to be with a Stake so the first few hits may be done with a sword. Advanced Vampires (named Vampires) have a passive chance of dropping Vampire Blood without the need of a Stake. Hunter Expert villagers may offer Vampire Blood as a trade. 

#### I have a toxicant effect
This happens if you wear hunter armor as a vampire or the other way around

#### How do I become human ("unvampire"/"unhunter")
As a vampire look for an *altar of cleansing* (or craft one), as a hunter use a *sanguinare injection* at a *med chair*.

#### How do I get vampire books
Vampire books can be found around the world (e.g. in mineshafts or vampire dungeons). They have cryptic names and content.
