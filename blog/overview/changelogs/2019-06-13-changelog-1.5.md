## Village Rework
- Villages work completely different now. Instead of being protected by hunter they belong to a faction or are completely neutral
-   They can be overtaken in a siege
-   They grant benefits to the controlling factions (special merchants, no sundamage, immune villagers, etc.)
-   New dual block structure (village totem)
-   About every second generated village is already controlled by a certain faction
-   Slowly replace surface blocks in vampire controlled villages

## NPC actions
-   NPCs (vampire, hunter) are now able to make use of some skills
-    The higher the level the more skills they can use
-    Actions are enabled depending on the situation and have a cooldown
-    There are a few classes of entities (e.g. "Assassin", "Tank", "Support") which have different sets of skills
-    Makes NPC fights a little bit more interesting/unique

## New feeding process (vampire)
-    Instead of immediately taking a small amount of blood at an instant, feeding is now a process
-    It slowly drains blood from the victim which is held in place for the time
-    Feeding can be aborted at any time

## Vampires souls (hunter)
-    If defeating vampires with a hunter weapon (stake, axe, crossbow, ...) they will drop a vampire soul orb
-    They can be traded with a hunter expert in hunter villages for valuable items
