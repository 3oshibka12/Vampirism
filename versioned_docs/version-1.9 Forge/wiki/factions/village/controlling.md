Villages can be controlled by a faction to spread their control and have access to certain features.
The [Totem](../../content/blocks#village-totem-top-base) is the controlling block for the village which can be interacted with by the faction members.

## Occurrence of villages

Natural villages have a chance to spawn with a [Fragile Totem](../../content/blocks#village-totem-top-base) and therefore be initially controlled by a faction.

## Raids

The faction of a village can be changed by raiding it. Raids can be triggered by 3 causes:
1. Player initiated raids
2. Random raids
3. Bad Omen raids

### Player initiated raids

Any player that has a different faction than the village can right-click on the totem to initiate a raid of the player's faction.

In Player initiated raids the defending faction will be twice as strong as the attacking faction.

### Random raids

Random raids can occur at any time, but the attacking faction will be weak in comparison to the defending faction.

In Random raids the defending faction will be twice as strong as the attacking faction.

### Bad Omen raids

Just like with Illager raids, Faction raids can be triggered by a player entering the village with a Bad Omen effect of a different faction.
For each faction there exists a Bad Omen effect which can be obtained by killing a faction member of that faction that carries a Banner of that faction. Killing another Banner holder while having the Bad Omen effect increases the level of the Bad Omen effect.
Just like the vanilla Bad Omen effect, the strength of the raid depends on the level of the Bad Omen effect.

With a Bad Omen effect level 1 the defending faction will be 4 times stronger than the attacking faction.  
With a Bad Omen effect level 5 the attacking faction will be 2 times stronger than the defending faction.

## Raiding

A faction raid is seperated in two phases:
1. Gathering phase
2. Final phase

### Gathering phase

In the gathering phase both the attacking and defending faction gather their forces depending on the raid's strength ratio. This will continuously spawn raiders and defenders.

### Final phase

Once in the final phase there will spawn no new raiders or defenders. When one faction has no members left the village will be taken over by the other faction or will keep ist defending faction.

If the village is neutral the final phase will be skipped and the village will be taken over by the attacking faction.

## Neutralize villages

A village can only be neutralized by members of the faction that controls the village by destroying the [Totem](../../content/blocks#village-totem-top-base).


## Additional notes
- Hunter Trainer / Undercover Hunter Trainer are not counted as Raid participants
- ringing a bell as raid participant will let entities of the other faction glow. Just like with Illagers
