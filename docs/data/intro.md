Vampirism uses data packs for vanilla related content as well as for some custom content. This allows users and content creators to further customized their Vampirism experience or even built new challenges.  
Have a look at the mod data directory [main](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/tree/1.16-1.8/src/main/resources/data) and [generated](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/tree/1.16-1.8/src/generated/resources). Or at the incomplete and outdated example repository [here](https://github.com/TeamLapen/VampirismDatapackExamples)

## How it works
Checkout the Minecraft Wiki to see how [datapacks](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Data_pack) work.  
[Installing them](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Installing_a_data_pack)  
[Creating them](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/Tutorials/Creating_a_data_pack)  

Also make sure you are familiar with the namespace concept. If you want to modify/override Vampirism's own definition you have to use "vampirism" for everything else use your own.

## Things that are customizable
Besides the already mentioned vanilla contents you can also customize:
- Player Skill Trees
- Blood Values
- Alchemical Cauldron Recipes
- Weapon Table Recipes
