### Selection of skills
#### Blood Potion
Using a Blood Potion Table you will be able to use some Vampire abilities for you.  
By mixing the Vampire Blood with garlic, you reduce it's toxicity, allowing you to drink it without dying.  
Caused by the strange nature of vampires the blood potion will have a random and unknown set of effects. Some of them will even be bad for you.  
By learning more about vampires and unlocking new skills, you might to be able to tell how many bad effects are in a potion or maybe identify some of the effects.  
With advanced techniques you also will be able to reduce the chance of bad effects.  
  
The Blood Potion Table also offers another slot. You can insert any item in there, which is then mixed into your potion. 
Thereby you might be able to affect the "direction" in which the effects might go.

#### Weapon Table
The Weapon Table allows you to craft advanced weapons including crossbows and more.  
Some of the recipe require lava so fill the table with a lava bucket by right clicking it.  
To see all recipes use Just Enough Items for now, but let me tell you there are some interesting things like double crossbows or even a "Van Helsing style" crossbow.
