This mod should play well on multiplayer servers. Players can choose to join the vampire faction or the hunter faction or even mostly ignore this mod if they want.

### Permissions
Certain actions can be controlled via permission. See [Permissions](permissions.md).

### PVP
You can disable PVP within factions, so only players from different factions can hurt each other and the war between vampires and humans can take place organized.

### Difficulty
Most hostile creatures appear in different levels.  
The strength of a spawned creature is affected by the level of nearby players. Around strong vampire players, strong hunters will spawn, but around normal humans (not hunter/not vampire) only weak vampires will appear.

### Commands
When using command blocks or similar for things you can use the included [entity selectors](commands.md#entity-selectors) to filter between hunters/vampire, levels etc. in most commands.  
There is also a scoreboard entry that can be used to find out the vampire/hunter/faction level of a player (`vampirism:vampire`, `vampirism:hunter` and `vampirism:faction`)

### Utility
#### Sundamage
For common places (e.g. spawn) you can place (cheat only) sunscreen beacons, so vampires can visit them during the day without taking sun damage.

#### Infection
Also interesting might be the config option to allow/deny players from infecting other human players with vampirism (hunters are immune anyway due to their garlic injection).
