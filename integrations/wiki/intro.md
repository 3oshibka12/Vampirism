Vampirism Integrations is a compatibility mod that adds integration between Vampirism and other mods. Some mods like Just Enough Items (JEI) or Guide-API are supported out of the box, but other mods require this mod to be installed to some integration.

In our quest to ensure continuous compatibility, we diligently maintain an updated list of supported mods and their associated features. Given the disparate update schedules of Vampirism and the mods it integrates with, we strive to keep pace with the emergence of new mods and the potential cessation of support for older ones.

It's important to note that if you encounter a version of Vampirism Integrations predating the release of an integrated mod for a new Minecraft version, the integration may not be incorporated until the subsequent release.
