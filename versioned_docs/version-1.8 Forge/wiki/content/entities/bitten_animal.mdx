Besides players, animals can also become vampire animals by infecting them. Not all animals are able to become vampires, but most vanilla animals can (mostly small animals are unable to become vampire).
After they are infected they fo through the same process as player to become vampire animals. Once that is completed their texture and behavior changes resulting in an aggressive creature with red eyes.
