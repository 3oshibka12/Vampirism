After becoming a hunter (see Getting Started) you probably want to reach higher levels. To level up you have to train yourself somehow.  
_The declared item amounts might not be up-to-date_  

## To reach level 2-4
To reach higher levels you have collect some vampire blood (Kill normal vampire NPCs with a stake).  
If you got enough look around for a normal hunter NPC. Interact with him and a GUI will open.  
Current required counts to reach  
Level 2: 4 Vampire Blood  
Level 3: 8 Vampire Blood  
Level 4: 12 Vampire Blood  

## To reach level 5+
To level up further you have to do some research first. Craft yourself a "Hunter Table" and open it's GUI. By inspecting some special items you will get some intel/reseach about vampires which you can use to level up at a Vampire Hunter Trainer in a village.  
For higher tiers of hunter intel you will need to upgrade the hunter table by placing certain blocks adjacent to it.
These blocks are: Weapon Table, Potion Table and Alchemical Cauldron.  
For the highest tier you will need all three blocks placed adjacent to the hunter table.
