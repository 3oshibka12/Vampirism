## Hunter only Potions
Hunter potions are special potions that only hunter can brew and consume. They are more expensive, but their effect is far stronger.

All Hunter potions can only be crafted in the [Hunter Potion Table](./blocks#potion-table) and require 1 [Vampire Blood](./items#vampire-blood) to brew.
