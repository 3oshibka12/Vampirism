## Important

All world gen related config is now in COMMON config. Old values elsewhere are ignored. This affects biome and mob spawn rates, hunter tent separation and village separation
Vampire Armor

- Vampires have natural armor when not wearing armor
- The amount of armor scales between iron and diamond from level 1 to level 14
- This natural armor does not stack with additionally worn armor
- If wearing heavy armor (anything stronger than leather) your vampire specific speed and attack speed buff will be cut by half
- Armor enchantments can be applied to (not yet rendered) stylish vampire clothing that can be equipped in the armor slots
- After respawning the armor will take some time to fully regenerate
- Vampires can wear new vampire clothing, that does not provide any protection but is enchantable

## Vampire Immortality

- Vampires do not immediately die from certain damage sources, instead they go into a down-but-not-out (DBNO) state where they can still be hit, but are ignored by mobs
- After some regeneration (timeout) phase, they can choose to resurrect. Alternatively, they can always decide to die and respawn instead
- After resurrecting vampires are weakened and instantly die when they are killed again in the next few minutes (neonatal effect)
- While DBNO vampire can be immediately finished using vampire killing weapons like stake, holy water or fire

## Vampire Accessories

- Vampires can now equip accessories (ring, amulet and obi belt) which give buffs (and debuffs) and can even modify certain skills
- There are many different effects and combinations of effects and you can try to collect the perfect set of ring, amulet and obi belt
- In total there are much more than 100.000 possible combinations, even though many are similar.
- Accessories cannot be unequipped and are destroyed if another is equipped in the same slots
- Upon respawning (after death) accessories take a random amount of damage and eventually break
- Certain accessories can for example change the dark blood projectile to a short range 360Â° attack
