## Procedure
1. Make sure you are using the [latest](https://modrinth.com/mod/vampirism/versions#all-versions) Vampirism version for your MC version
2. Search open and closed issues [here](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/issues?q=is%3Aissue) for similar bugs
3. Check known issues below
4. Make sure the issue is directly related to Vampirism or does only occur with Vampirism installed
5. Open an issue [here](https://github.com/TeamLapen/Vampirism/issues?q=is%3Aissue) (or on Discord) and fill in the template completely. **If the game crashes provide the crash report.** See below

## Generic Issues
### Vampires or other mobs are not spawning
First check if you
1. can spawn the creature in a creative world
2. find any suspicious log entry
3. have a mod (or server plugin) installed that affects spawn behavior
4. can reproduce the problem with just Vampirism installed
5. can reproduce the issue in a fresh single-player world

Then, and only then, report an issue on Github or Discord describing the issue and linking the used modpack.
Please also report on any findings.

## Known issues
### Game crashes on player death
Some mod is likely messing with Forge capabilities/player entities.
#### Mohist (1.16)
Certain version of Mohist `1.16#700-740` are bugged.




## Crash report
**If your game crashes or does not start, we do NEED a crash-report**

_Without a crash-report file, we can do absolutely nothing to help you._  
_So please follow the following steps (If you have questions about the steps themselves, feel free to ask):_

1. Find the Minecraft crash report file. If you use the standard Minecraft launcher, the folder can be found [here](https://minecraft.gamepedia.com/.minecraft). The interesting file is inside the _crash-reports_, choose the latest file. If you use another launcher, it might have a function to easily upload or locate log files.
2. Create an issue here, describe the problem and include the log either within a spoiler or as a [Paste](http://paste.ee) of it. Alternatively you can post it on our Discord.

There is a helpful guide [here](https://hypixel.net/threads/guide-how-to-post-a-crash-report.577718/)

You can also use a launcher that allows you to easily upload logs and crash-reports.
