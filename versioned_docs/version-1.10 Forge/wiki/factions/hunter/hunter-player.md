## Traits 
* Players are immune to the vampires poisonous [Sanguinare Vampiris](../../content/effects#sanguinare-vampiris) bite
* Players can have different Hunter levels
* With higher levels, the hunters become stronger
* Hunters are specialized with weapons, armor and other equipment
* Can use stakes to e.g., instantly kill vampires below 30% health
* Normal vampire NPCs killed with a stake will drop [Vampire Blood](../../content/items#pure-blood) which can be used for leveling or in the [Potion table](../../content/blocks#potion-table) (see below)

## Leveling
More information [here](./leveling) 

## Skills
Hunter Players can unlock skills. More information [here](./skills).

### Selection of skills
#### Blood Potion
Using a [Blood Potion Table](../../content/blocks#potion-table) hunters can brew more potions and can increase the effect of the potions even more.

[Available Potions](../../content/potions)


#### Weapon Table
The [Weapon Table](../../content/blocks#weapon-table) allows you to craft advanced weapons including crossbows and more.  
Some recipes require lava, so fill the table with a lava bucket by right-clicking it.  
To see all recipes, use Just Enough Items for now, but let me tell you there are some interesting things like double crossbows or even a "Van Helsing style" crossbow.

## Stop being a Hunter
If you should choose to be no longer a hunter,
you can craft a [Sanguiare Injection](../../content/items#injection)
and inject yourself with it at an injection chair.
