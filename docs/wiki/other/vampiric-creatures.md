title: Vampiric Creature
---

Vampiric Creatures are vampire variants or normal creatures like cows, sheeps, pigs etc. They can naturally spawn in the Vampire Forest or can be turned by Vampires. While some creatures lose their functionality most will keep their behavior eg tamed horses.

(By default there are only vanilla creatures that can be turned if you want to add modded entities take a look [here](biteable-creatures-blood-grinder.md#adding-a-new-convertible-creature))

# Turning creatures
Creatures can be turned by either a vampire player or other vampire entities. While player can bite the creatures and suck their blood all at once other vampire entites only drinks blood from other entities if they are thirsty. At the point that the creatures blood has been used up there is a 1/1 chance that the creature dies or gets turned into a vampiric version of itself.

At time of writing following creatures can be turned: Cow, Llama, Cat, Panda, Pig, Polarbear, Rabbit, Sheep, Villager, Horse

If there is no vampiric version of the creature the creature just dies as soon as they do not have blood left.

# Curing creatures
Curing vampiric creatures is the same as curing a Zombie villager.

1) apply the weakness effect to the creature  
2) right-click the creature with a golden apple  
3) wait for the creature to be cured
