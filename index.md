## General

The following is supposed to give you an quick overview over the major features of Vampirism.  
There are small features, adjustments or tweaks which are not mentioned here (advancements, some loot gen, mob interaction and more).

### Mobs

<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://teamlapen.github.io/Vampirism/img/vampires.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
Vampire mobs spawn in the same biomes zombies spawn. They are night active and hunt for non-vampire players. They also occasionally suck blood from animals.  
The basic vampires have different levels which affect their health as well as damage. Their level is chosen based on the levels of nearby players when they are spawned.  
Moreover, there are advanced vampires, which are even stronger, but drop better loot. Sometimes normal vampires follow them.  
They are named after people who contributed to this mod. 
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://teamlapen.github.io/Vampirism/img/hunter_camp.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
Vampire hunter spawn in small camps generated around the world. They hunt vampires, but usually stay close to their tent.  
They also spawn in different levels and sometimes there is an advanced hunter in the camp.
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://teamlapen.github.io/Vampirism/img/vampire_forest_baron.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
Vampire barons appear in the vampire forest. They are very strong and have abulic minions that fight for them.  
They do not like other powerful vampires in their territory, so they attack vampire players and other barons.

In the vampire forest there are vampire versions of the vanilla mobs.  
If you suck all of a creature's blood it might also turn into a vampire version.  

### Village
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://teamlapen.github.io/Vampirism/img/village.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
Villages play an important role in Vampirism, since there are many blood-rich villagers there.  
Vampirism (slightly) increases the density and size of villages in the world.  
There are usually some vampire hunter watching the village to protect the villagers from vampires.  
The more villagers are killed by vampires (or fed of) the more hunter come around. If it get's to wild, some of the villagers will get angry and get their pitchforks to defend themselves.  

### Configuration
<p style="text-align:center;"><img src="https://teamlapen.github.io/Vampirism/img/config.jpg" width="200px"/></p>
Many aspects of the game are configurable. Instead of modifying the configuration files you can also use the ingame menu.  
Almost all balance related values are configurable in the balance section. After an update players are asked if they want to override their modified values with the (potentially) updated ones. This does not affect the general configuration.

### Items and Blocks
