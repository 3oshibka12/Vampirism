## Blood
Blood is the food source for vampires.

It can be acquired in two different ways

##### 1. Biting creatures
Vampires can bite creatures with blood to directly consume it or fill it into a (Blood-) Bottle.

- consumed blood can transfered into (Blood-) Bottles
- blood can also be drunk from filled Blood Container
- with a Feeding Adapter in hand you can even drink from a Blood Container in your inventory

##### 2. Filter Impure Blood
By placing a Blood Sieve with a Blood Container below and a Blood Container filled with Impure Blood above the sieve will filter the Impute Blood into drinkable blood.

- instead of impure blood there are some other modded blood fluids that can be filtered.
- this methods can be automated with fluid transportation mods

## Impure Blood
Impure Blood is an intermediate product that can be won by grinding meat in the Blood Grinder and filtered into drinkable Blood.

To use the Blood Grinder simply insert meat that contain blood and place a Blood Container below.

- instead of a Blood Container you can directly place the Blood Sieve below
- this process can be automated with fluid transportation mods as well
