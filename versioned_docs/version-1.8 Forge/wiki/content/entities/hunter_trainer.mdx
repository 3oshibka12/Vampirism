The Hunter Trainer is the most important entity for the progression of hunter players. Because he knows nearly everything about vampires, hunter players need to trade with him to obtain [Hunter Intel](../items#hunter-intel).
Because the Hunter Trainer has his house in villages that can be controlled by Vampires, he goes undercover to protect himself if there are no hunters in the area.

### Balancing
Because the Hunter Trainer is essential to the hunter leveling, and he does not respawn, the Hunter Trainer is invulnerable.
