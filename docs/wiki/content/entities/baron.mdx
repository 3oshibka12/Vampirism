The Vampire Barons are powerful Vampire Lords that can be found in the Vampire Forest. They see any other powerful being as hostile and will attack any other vampire baron or player. Lower vampires on the other hand are welcome to follow the baron's orders.

#### Versions

Barons come in different variants. For one, they can be either male or female, but they come also in different levels ranging from 1 to 5. The higher their level the stronger they are and the more follower the can have.
