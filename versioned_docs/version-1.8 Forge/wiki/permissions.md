Vampirism utilizes Forge's permissions system for a few actions. Thereby it should be compatible with Forge based permission mods as well as SpongeForge's permission system.

### Available permissions
- `vampirism.check` Should be given to all players. Used to check if the permission system works
- `vampirism.bite.attack` Attack a mob by biting
- `vampirism.bite.attack.player` Attack a player by biting
- `vampirism.bite.feed` Feed from an animal
- `vampirism.bite.feed.player` Feed from a player
- `vampirism.infect.player` Infect a player with sanguinare vampirism by biting
- `vampirism.action.*` Allow a player to use the specific action (e.b. `vampirism.action.vampirism.bat)
