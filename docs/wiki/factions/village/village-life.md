## Faction Behavior

Once a village is controlled by a faction, all workstations and beds will be claimed by the faction. This means that only faction members can destroy them.

## Villager

### Villager Professions

Each faction has a new Profession that has trades relevant for the respective faction. As workstation for these professions acts the [Totem Top](../../content/blocks#village-totem-top-base) when it is controlled by the faction.

### Faction Specifics
#### Vampire Village

In a Vampire Village, all villager will slowly be converted to Vampire Villagers. Some Villager may be turned/infected upon capturing the village, all others will be infected by Vampires or Vampire Villager.

Vampire Villager will change their day/night cycle to be active during the night and sleep during the day.

#### Hunter Village

In a Hunter Village, all villager are protected against vampire bites by poisonous blood. In a raid some will take up arms and fight with pitchforks.
## Faction Representative

In a controlled village a [Faction Representative](../../content/entities/village_representative) will eventually spawn. The representative is not a Villager, but a task giver for interested faction player.
He gives out tasks that require the player to complete different actions or collect items. The representative is also relevant in becoming a [Lord](../vampire-hunter-lord-and-minions)
